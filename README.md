*This program is currently under development and the code is insufficient as it is in the early stages. Also, there are no plans to release BOT.





## **Introduction**

This program is a DiscordBOT development program created with Replit.

The purpose is to set prohibited words using chat commands, automatically delete prohibited words in the list if they are included in a sentence, and to manage words that can be restricted according to user privileges.

## **Feature**

As mentioned above, the main function is


`!add_word [1]    #Add word to list of banned words`

`!remove_word [1] #Remove word from list of banned words`
 
`Auther.OpenList  #Publish banned word list to chat`


By entering the above commands in the Discord chat, the BOT will take actions corresponding to each command.

If the conversation contains prohibited words


`Contains prohibited words!`

will be deleted in response.


*The following is a scene with prohibited words added.<br>
　　　"!add_word a"<br>
　　　"Forbidden word "a" added."<br>
